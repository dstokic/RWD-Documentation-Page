      <p>Code is the backbone of everything you see on the internet, your phone, your laptop, etc. Almost anything you can think of that humans have created has some kind of code running in order to provide you that service or item.</p>
      <p>Of course though, since there are so many different things that code is expected to do, there are many different programming languages that have unique pros and cons. There are over 200 different notable programming languages all of which have evolved to do many different things.</p>
      <p>This page will take you through a small sampling of the languages available and what they are best for. If you want to skip to a certain language in particular then click on its name in the sidebar.</p>

      <p>C is one of the oldest commonly used programming languages and is the basis for lots of common programming languages used today such as Java, Javascript, and C#. It is usually up to a programmer to chose whether they want to learn C or just skip to C++ since it is more advanced. Some say that C provides a useful foundation whereas others think that it isn't worth it if you go on to learn C++.</p>
      <p>C can be used across platforms like mobile, desktop, and embedded. It is probably worth to learn either C or C++ as they are the language used for a lot of the operating systems and file systems. A drawback of C is that because it is so old and the syntax so complex, it really can't be used to solve complex real world problems like other languages can.</p>
      <code>//This program prints "Hello World!" using C
            int main() {
               printf("Hello, World!");
               return 0;
            }

      <p>C++ is obviously an offshot of C and therefore has a lot of the same functionalities and drawbacks that C has with some improvements. C++ is slightly easier, though still relatively difficult, to learn for a beginner and it is one of the worlds most popular languages. Though C++ will likely prove to be a challenge to learn for someone who has never coded before.</p>
      <p class="intro">What companies use C++:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google</li>

      <p>HTML, also known as HyperText Markup Language, is a very easy language to learn since it's syntax is very easy to pick up. This programming language is used almost exclusively used to make websites and isn't very useful for doing anything else. Every website you visit on the internet uses HTML in order to render what the developer wants you to see. HTML by itself does not look very appealing and usually you will here of something called CSS alongside it. </p>
      <p>CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets, is the language that is used to make websites look a lot prettier than HTML is capable of doing. This is responsible for changing the style of the webpage, the layout, the font, the color, and endless of other things. There is a lot of really interesting things a person can do using CSS alongside HTML.</p>
      <code>HTML is easy as you only need to encase the words "Hello World!" in h1 tags as depicted below:
        <h1>Hello World</h1></code>

      <p>Java is a very ubiquitous programming language in the world today as it is an easy-to-understand language (around the intermediate level) that is capable of doing a ton of different things over various different platforms. This is largely because Java is an object-oriented programming language and code can be easy reused whenever needed.</p>
      <p>Because Java has such a large community there is a ton of support and knowledge for new learners to find. It is a good language to start on because although it is slightly more diffiuclt than other languages, it allows you to start thinking like a programmer and introduces you to technical jargon.</p>
      <code>//This program prints "Hello World!" using Java
            class HelloWorld {
              public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
              }

    <article>
      <p>JavaScript is an extremely popular language and can be used in various different places to do various different things. It's extreme popularity means that it is also worth learning especially because it is relatively simply to learn. Javascript can also be used in web design in order to create more interactive designs and displays.</p>
      <p>Of course JavaScript does have a few drawbacks, one of the main ones being that it can exploited because the code is run on the client side and therefore doesn't have as much protection as a company owned server system would have.</p>
      <p class="intro">Companies that use Javascript:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google</li>

      <p>Perl is a programming language that is similar to C and C++, so any knowledge of those will make learning Perl easier. It also takes a lot of the best parts of a ton of different other programming languages. Perl is also more consise than code in C and C++ which makes it easier to debug and read code. It is most often used in web development or to process text files and strings due to its text-processing power. Perl is still a language that is being used by quite a few programmers and if it interests you, it would likely be worth learning.</p>
      <p class="intro">Companies that use Perl:</p>

      <p>PHP was created in 1990 and is an open-source programming language. PHP is mostly used for server-side web development and most people hoping to become web developers should learn this language as it is used in around 80% of the websites currently on the Internet. It is important to keep in mind though that while PHP is used my many websites, it is becoming used less and less.</p>
      <p>Some of the general issues that plague PHP are that it is not very good at handling errors that it may run into, in certain situations it isn't very secure, and it isn't well suited for larger applications as it can't really handle everything those sort of systems require.</p>
      <p class="intro">Companies that use PHP:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Facebook</li>

      <p>Python is one of the simplest programming languages to learn. It is capable of doing lots of things, but unlike many other programming languages, it uses simplified syntax which is easier for a beginner to understand. Of course the benefit of it being easier to understand comes with the drawback of it having a slower runtime which may not be ideal for certain situations.</p>
      <p>Python is also an extremely useful language not only because it is easy to learn, but because there are also a lot of jobs that use it. It can be used in various fields such as data science or AI just to list a few. In the fields like the ones previously listed, Python is the most useful because of its various packages and libraries which make doing certain things a lot less labor intensive on the programmer.</p>

        print('Hello, world!')</code>

      <p>Ruby is a relatively easy language to learn and this ease is why it and Ruby on Rails is one of the favorite programming languages of web developers. Ruby is also very good for beginners because it has a reputation for being one of the friendliest and most helpful programming communities.</p>
      <p>Ruby is a language used for web development and is steadily growing in popularity among the programming community. One thing that Ruby does that not many other language do is enforce good programming style.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Scala takes a lot of its features from Java while also adding its own twist on it. It is also so related to Java that you can actually program Java at some points in Scala programs and have it still function normally. Scala is also pretty good at ensuring that a lot of bugs never have the chance to occur. Scala is also probably not going away anytime soon as there is nothing that can do exactly what it can to such a scale at the moment, so as far as learning languages go, Scala is a good bet.</p>
      <p class="intro">Companies that use Scala:</p>
      <ul>

    <article>
      <p>Swift was developed by Apple in 2014 in order to make it easier to develop apps. It is relatively easy for a person to learn even if they have no program experience, but sometimes the syntax can be off-puting. Although that shouldn't be too much of a problem with all of the tutorials available on the internet which can make it a lot easier to problem shoot.</p>
      <p>Swift is generally a programming language that runs very quickly. Some of the downsides of Swift include that it is a relatively new langauge and therefore isn't very compatible with other tools and that it is really limited to only developing apps for the iOS store.</p>
      <code>// This prints "Hello, World!" using Swift
            print("Hello, World!")
